Practice Project

Video Demo: https://youtu.be/00rfA0yzYuQ

Practiced JavaFX, SceneBuilder, JDK 11, Java I/O.
Only works for windows system by default(could change path for where the data is saved to match different OS), since directory is set to be created in C drive.


*Note JavaFX 11 is used to create this project, which apparently isn't included in the openJDK, and so you must manually install JavaFX when running into the error regarding JavaFX runtime components missing*

*Make sure to keep your Java up to date. Minimum version: 1.8.0*
*If console show JavaFX toolkit error and fails to run, make sure to update/download the latest JavaFX runtime.*

Similar to a chatbot. Allows user to associate a response to an input, and when the specific input is sent, the program returns the
response. You can save,load, or delete savedatas via the Data manager which is opened by clicking the Data button.
